- 👋 Hi, I’m @moizfayyaz1
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development and web frameworks. 
- 🌱 I know front end development and currently learning back end development. My most recent work is a Dall-e OpenAI clone which creates an AI generated image based on a prompt provided by the user. This project was completed using MERN stack.
